\begin{abstract}
% With the proliferation of cloud-based robotics, 
The ability for machines to accurately compute and successfully execute candidate grasps on adversarial target objects is paramount to the future success of robotic automation in industry and in our homes. To reach acceptable levels of performance, robots must rely on either expert domain knowledge, which can be expensive to acquire, or complex machine learning algorithms, which require large amounts of data to train and may be specific to a single robot's geometry. 

Cloud Robotics helps offload these costs from end-robotics-users to Platform as as Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. These services accelerate the development velocity of robotic systems and avoid complex software installation and maintenance costs. The availability of myriad specialized robotic software implementations, however, creates its own problem of vendor lock-in, increasing the switching cost associated with using new robotic hardware and software.

We present Dex-Net as a service (DNaaS), a cloud-based grasp planning system for parallel-jaw grippers built on top of Dexterity Network 2.0 (Dex-Net). Unlike other cloud-based grasp planners, DNaaS can be parameterized to compute grasps using arbitrarily specified parallel-jaw grippers. DNaaS accepts generic 3D object meshes over HTTP and returns a set of candidate stable-pose grasps ranked by their Ferrari-Canny probability of force closure under sampled uncertainty in object and gripper pose and friction.  To try the system live, visit  {\tt http://automation.berkeley.edu/dex-net}.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
The development of Cloud Robotics highlights the utility of a shared knowledge base of common interfaces to robotic control policies. 
 Data repositories such as ROS and RoboEarth enable internet connected robots to draw from, and ultimately contribute their sensing data back to, a unified robotic knowledge graph \cite{roboearth}. Already we are seeing the fruits of democratized and commoditized robotics in automated manufacturing services used for rapid hardware design \cite{tempo} and web-based science laboratories aimed at streamlining controlled experiments  \cite{emerald}.


Such repositories of information can present their own complications, as each module in the system may come coupled to a specific robot, operating on a narrow set of environments and objects \cite{worldrobotics}. As a result, end users of such systems may become locked-in \cite{lockin} and unable to upgrade their grasping hardware due to an incompatible software dependency. Likewise, roboticists may be unable to upgrade their grasping software due to the constraints of their current hardware.

A similar phenomenon of vendor lock-in occurs in the software industry, where it can prevent consumers from using optimal software tooling due to the prohibitively high switching-costs of migrating between software providers. Data, application, and infrastructure lock-in are serious concerns for consumers leveraging cloud services \cite{vendorlockarticle, vendorlockpaper}. The robotics industry is no different, as the installation of new gripper hardware on robotic fleets due to a forced software upgrade may require serious capital expenditure.

We present Dex-Net as a Service (DNaaS), an HTTP API for computing and ranking grasps on generic 3D object meshes using arbitrary parallel jaw grippers. DNaaS leverages GQ-CNNs \cite{dexnet2} to enable the computation of optimal stable pose grasps. We present six experiments over which we vary the parallel-jaw grippers of the robot, as well as the RGB-D camera used for object perception to access the performance of DNaaS in real-life situations across multiple hardware configurations. 

To visualize our grasping algorithm, we also developed a web UI from which you can adjust your hardware settings and upload object meshes to experiment with DNaaS using your own data. Our contributions are thus three-fold:
\begin{itemize}
\item We present DNaaS, a public HTTP API which computes and ranks grasps on arbitrary 3D object meshes  (in {\tt .obj} format with triangular faces) using arbitrarily specified parallel jaw grippers and RGB-D sensors,
\item We develop a web UI from which users can upload candidate objects and evaluate the robustness of stable pose grasps, and
\item We evaluate the real-time performance of DNaaS across varied hardware configurations and adversarial object grasps.
\end{itemize}

Each candidate grasp is represented by a line-segment whose color corresponds to the grasp's robustness (red being the least robust, green the most robust).}

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. 
It may be used for A4 paper size if the paper size setting is suitably modified.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{EXPERIMENTS}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
